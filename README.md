Task1

We choice to build a blockchain application for an intellectual property rights management system.


three problems/challenges of the chosen domain that could be addressed
1.The project is quite complicated, so we need to make our project well documented and use git to do the version control.
2.



3 Functional Requirements:

1.Trading system. The owner of IP can sell their IP and users can buy IP from the owner as well.

2.Auction system. IP holders can auction their IP through this system. Holders can set the starting price and the duration.

3.A voting phrase that to decide if register the IP in the system. Users can apply to register their IP, and authorized people can vote. If the IP got more than half, the IP could be registered into the system.

3 Non-Functional Requirements

1.We will apply signature in order to increase the security of the whole system.

2.We need to limit users to access primary functions in order to increase the usability of the whole system. For example, users can only register 3 IP in one day.

3.Each part of the system should have completed testing capabilities, including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
