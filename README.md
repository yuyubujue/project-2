# project-2

Task1


1. Our team has chosen to build a blockchain application for in the Intellectual Property (IP) Rights Management domain.


2. Our application will solve the problem of transparency in ownership of IP rights and also transfer of IP rights.


3. Three Challenges


IP Rights require publicly provable ownership in order to reduce ownership disputes.
- Tokenisation of IP Rights register asset ownership on blockchain infrastructure.
- The blockchain provides an immutable history of IP rights ownership.
- Oracles can be utilised to communicate with Government IP Registration Offices.
- Our application can be able to help IP Right owners to register their Intellectual Property in the blockchain, providing a clear
   record of ownership.


IP owners have difficulty trading their property in a liquid market.
- Tokenisation of IP produces a tradable asset representing ownership of real IP.
- Tokens can be traded over the blockchain and registration transferred through Smart Contracts.
- Our application can establish a market for trading of tokenised IP Rights though direct trade and auction mechanisms reducing complexity to IP Owners.


Royalty Payments are negotiated though direct agreements between Owner and Licencee.
- Smart contracts can standardise payment mechanism for usage of Intellectual Property
- Our application can create a market for licencing IP and automating royalty payment process.

    
4. Three Functional Requirements:

1.Trading system. The owner of IP can sell their IP and users can buy IP from the owner as well.

2.Auction system. IP holders can auction their IP through this system. Holders can set the starting price and the duration.

3.A voting phrase that to decide if register the IP in the system. Users can apply to register their IP, and authorized people can vote. If the IP got more than half, the IP could be registered into the system.

3 Non-Functional Requirements

1.We will apply signature in order to increase the security of the whole system.

2.We need to limit users to access primary functions in order to increase the usability of the whole system. For example, users can only register 3 IP in one day.

3.Each part of the system should have completed testing capabilities, including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
